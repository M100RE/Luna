# Renderer
## OpenGL UI Renderer
This is a simple OpenGL GUI renderer, which allows you to user various constraints in your ui.
for example, if you wanted a button to be 20% the size of the frame or 20px from the right border etc.

## Build Process
This is a cmake project. Your need to install OpenGL and glfw and then you are ready to build.


## What's Next
I want to add a lot of UI elements like a slider class and a textbox class
